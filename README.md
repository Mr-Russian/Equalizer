## Equalizer Example

This is just an example of an Equalizer application using the [NVDSP](https://github.com/bartolsthoorn/NVDSP) library for the equalizer part and [Novocaine](https://github.com/alexbw/novocaine) for the playing audio part. Use this as an example of how to make your own equalizer.
